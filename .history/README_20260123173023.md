## Features

### 🎤 Voice Clone
Clone voices from your own audio samples. Just provide a 3-10 second reference audio with its transcript, and generate new speech in that voice.

- **Voice prompt caching** - First generation processes the sample, subsequent ones are instant
- **Seed control** - Reproducible results with saved seeds
- **Metadata tracking** - Each output saves generation info (sample, seed, text)

### 🎨 Voice Design
Create voices from natural language descriptions - no audio needed!

- Describe age, gender, emotion, accent, speaking style
- Generate unique voices matching your description

### 🔄 Clone Design
Use your saved voice designs to generate new content with full style control.

1. Save designs you like from Voice Design tab
2. Load saved designs anytime
3. Generate new content with consistent voice style

### 🎭 Custom Voice
Generate with premium pre-built voices with optional style instructions:

| Speaker | Description | Language |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Vivian | Bright, slightly edgy young female | Chinese |
| Serena | Warm, gentle young female | Chinese |
| Uncle_Fu | Seasoned male, low mellow timbre | Chinese |
| Dylan | Youthful Beijing male, clear natural | Chinese (Beijing) |
| Eric | Lively Chengdu male, husky brightness | Chinese (Sichuan) |
| Ryan | Dynamic male, strong rhythmic drive | English |
| Aiden | Sunny American male, clear midrange | English |
| Ono_Anna | Playful Japanese female, light nimble | Japanese |
| Sohee | Warm Korean female, rich emotion | Korean |

- Style instructions supported (emotion, tone, speed)
- Each speaker works best in native language but supports all

### 💬 Conversation
Create multi-speaker dialogues automatically:

- Write scripts in simple format: `Speaker: Dialogue text`
- Mix any of the 9 premium speakers
- Adjustable pause duration between lines
- Auto-stitches all lines into one audio file

Example script:
```
Ryan: Hey, how's it going?
Vivian: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
Aiden: Mind if I join this conversation?
```

### 🎛️ Prep Samples
Full audio preparation workspace:

- **Trim** - Use waveform selection to cut audio
- **Normalize** - Balance audio levels
- **Convert to Mono** - Ensure single-channel audio
- **Transcribe** - Whisper-powered automatic transcription
- **Save as Sample** - One-click sample creation

## Models Used

- **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base** - Voice cloning
- **Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign** - Voice design from descriptions
- **Whisper Medium** - Audio transcription

Models are automatically downloaded on first use.

## Tips

- **Reference Audio**: Use clear, noise-free recordings (3-10 seconds)
- **Transcripts**: Should exactly match what's spoken in the audio
- **Caching**: Voice prompts are cached - first generation is slow, subsequent ones are fast
- **Seeds**: Use the same seed to reproduce identical outputs
